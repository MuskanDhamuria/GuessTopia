**GuessTopia** is a Wordle-inspired word guessing game built as a **personal project** to explore game logic, animations, and responsive UI design using vanilla web technologies.

Players have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word, receiving visual feedback for correct, present, and absent letters—just like the classic Wordle experience.
